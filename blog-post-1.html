            <h1>My User Interface - KkthnxUI</h1>
            <p>Since 2012, I have been developing and refining my custom user interface for World of Warcraft, known as
                KkthnxUI. It is a comprehensive UI overhaul that provides a clean and minimalist interface, optimized
                for performance and usability.</p>
            <p>With KkthnxUI, I aim to enhance the gaming experience by providing players with a visually appealing and
                highly functional UI. The UI is designed to be lightweight and customizable, allowing players to tailor
                it to their preferences and playstyle.</p>
            <p>As the developer of KkthnxUI, I constantly update and maintain the interface to ensure compatibility with
                the latest game patches and add new features based on user feedback and suggestions.</p>
            <p>For more information about KkthnxUI, you can visit the <a
                    href="https://curseforge.com/projects/kkthnxui">CurseForge</a> page or the GitHub repository.</p>
